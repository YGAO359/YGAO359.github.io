## What is Machine Learning?

"A computer program is said to learn from experience *E* with respect to some class of tasks *T* and performance measure *P*

if its performance at tasks in *T*, as measured by *P*, improves with experience *E*."

### Machine Learning Types

The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.

The most frequently used method is based on the data of input and output:

1. **Supervised Learning**: builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. 
*Classification* algorithms and *regression* algorithms are types of supervised learning.

2. **Semi-supervised Learning**: develops mathematical models from incomplete training data, where a portion of the sample input doesn't have labels.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**: builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains only inputs and no desired output labels to discover patterns in data, like grouping or clustering of data points.
