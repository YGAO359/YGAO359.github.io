## What is Machine Learning?

"A computer program is said to learn from experience *E* with respect to some class of tasks *T* and performance measure *P*

if its performance at tasks in *T*, as measured by *P*, improves with experience *E*."

### Machine Learning Tasks

1. **Supervised Learning**: builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. 
*Classification* algorithms and *regression* algorithms are types of supervised learning.

2. **Semi-supervised Learning**: develops mathematical models from incomplete training data, where a portion of the sample input doesn't have labels.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**: builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains only inputs and no desired output labels to discover patterns in data, like grouping or clustering of data points.
