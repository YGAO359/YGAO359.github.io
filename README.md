## Hello, world!

Welcome to my homepage!

My name is GAO Yu. Now I am a student of Master of IT in Business, Singapore Management University.

A data analyst...neither a data scientist nor a coder,

though I fulfilled [the applied data science specialization from Umich in Coursera](https://github.com/YGAO359/YGAO359.github.io/blob/master/image/Data%20Science%20in%20Python.png)

and get certified as [the advanced programmer for SAS 9](https://github.com/YGAO359/YGAO359.github.io/blob/master/image/SAS%20Adv.png).

It is the learning in SMU that makes me aware of how a data analyst should process and interpret data. 

Thanks for the instruction from Prof.Kam. If you are interested in data analytics, you might wish to have a look of our [posters](https://github.com/YGAO359/YGAO359.github.io/tree/master/image/shared%20posters)

(The poster is around 10mb each, be patient)



### What is the homepage for?

For myself, this homepage is the table of contents, giving me a quick guide of important but infrequent-used methods.

For others, I hope you can find what you want.

### Table of Contents:
1. Applied Machine Learning in Python
2. Shiny App in R
3. Portfolio Optimization in SAS
