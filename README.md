## Hello, world!

Welcome to my homepage!

My name is GAO Yu. Now I am a student of Master of IT in Business, Singapore Management University.

A data analyst...neither a data scientist nor a coder.


### What is homepage?

For myself, this homepage is the table of contents, giving me a quick guide of important but infrequent-used methods.

For others, I hope you can find what you want, either my technical resume or tips.

### Table of Contents:
1. Applied Machine Learning in Python
2. Shiny App in R
3. Portfolio Optimization in SAS
